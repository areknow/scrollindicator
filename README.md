# scrollindicator
scrollindicator.js is a jQuery plugin that adds a bar on your page, which indicates the percentage of the page that has been scrolled.

###Depedencies
This is a jQuery plugin, so jQuery must be imported to your project prior scrollindicator.js script.

You can do this by importing the following line to your webpage inside the <head> tag:
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"> </script>
```

<hr>
###Initialization
To initialize the plugin add the following JavaScript code into your project:
```
(function($) {
    'use strict';
     
     $(document).ready(function() {
         
         $('body').scrollindicator();

     });
     
})(jQuery);
```
This plugin provides you some optional options which you can use to achieve customization. The options are presented below.
For instance:
```
$('body').scrollindicator({ 
            backgroundColor: 'transparent',
            color: 'black',
            gradientFinish: 'yellow',
            where: 'header',
            position: 'top',
            width: '5px'

```
